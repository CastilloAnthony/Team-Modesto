discord music game bot
  -capable of primarily an audio-based(voiceChat) guessing game
  -Secondarily, the bot will be capable of a lyrical(text-based) guessing game too

We'll need multiple functions:
-function apiHandShake() --should return true or false depending on if the handshake was successful

-funciton grabPlaylistData() --might return a vector/array of the raw 

-function randomizePlaylist() --this should create a semirandom vector/array based on the one that we used to pull the original playist from

-function getPlayers()

-function readTextChat()

-function joinVoiceChannel()

We'll also want to have some "global" variables
-vector playListData

-vector rAndomizedPlaylistData

-int player count

And more!!
